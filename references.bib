	abstract = {We present an eﬀect system for core Eﬀ, a simpliﬁed variant of Eﬀ , which is an ML-style programming language with ﬁrst-class algebraic eﬀects and handlers. We deﬁne an expressive eﬀect system and prove safety of operational semantics with respect to it. Then we give a domain-theoretic denotational semantics of core Eﬀ , using Pitts’s theory of minimal invariant relations, and prove it adequate. We use this fact to develop tools for ﬁnding useful contextual equivalences, including an induction principle. To demonstrate their usefulness, we use these tools to derive the usual equations for mutable state, including a general commutativity law for computations using non-interfering references. We have formalized the eﬀect system, the operational semantics, and the safety theorem in Twelf.},

	abstract = {We present an algebraic treatment of exception handlers and, more generally, introduce handlers for other computational effects representable by an algebraic theory. These include nondeterminism, interactive input/output, concurrency, state, time, and their combinations; in all cases the computation monad is the free-model monad of the theory. Each such handler corresponds to a model of the theory for the effects at hand. The handling construct, which applies a handler to a computation, is based on the one introduced by Benton and Kennedy, and is interpreted using the homomorphism induced by the universal property of the free model. This general construct can be used to describe previously unrelated concepts from both theory and practice.},
